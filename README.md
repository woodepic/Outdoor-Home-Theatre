# Outdoor-Home-Theatre

This is a reupload of an old project, as I did not use Github at the time. This project spanned July 2018 - March 2020, and I am happy to report it is still working perfectly to this day (January 2022). 

I created an enclosure for a projector, sound equiptment, and various other A/V electronics which resides outdoors all year round. Where I live, outdoor temperatures can span -40*c to + 40*c, so creating a climate controlled system robhust and powerful enough for such a climate is a challenging task. 

The enclosure utilizes a 5000BTU air conditioner, high speed fans, and a 250w heater. Using an arduino and various temperature sensors, it monitors and accounts for changes in temperature to keep the system running no matter the climate.
